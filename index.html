                Introduced by Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968, L-Systems are often
                used to model the growth processes of trees, plants, and other
                organisms, as well as procedurally generating complex geometry,
                fractals, and other patterns.
              </p>
              <p>

                L-Systems consist of a set of rules that are iteratively
                applied to an initial axiom and produce a string defining the
                state of the system at each generation. This resulting sentence
                can be then be converted to a visual representation of the
                system.

                An example:<br/>
                &nbsp;Starting axiom: <em>A</em><br/>
                &nbsp;Rules: <em>(A -> AB), (B -> A)</em><br/>
                &nbsp;Generations: <em>A => AB => ABA => ABAAB => ABAABABA</em>
                <ul>

                Strange Attractors tend to have beautiful, complex, fractal
                structures that are highly dependent on starting factors. This
                experiment implements a number of attractors, including
                Clifford, Fractal Dream, and Hopalong (my personal favorite). 
              </p>
              <p>
                The input parameters of the attractors are interactive and the
                attractor can be visualized as a series of points or the path
                generated by the points over time.

                Conway's Game of Life is a 2-dimensional cellular automata
                simulation invented by John Conway in 1970. It has 4 simple
                rules that govern the behavior of the automata:
                <ol>
                  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as
                  if by underpopulation.</li>
                  <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on
                  to the next generation.</li>
                  <li>Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies, as if
                  by overpopulation.</li>
                  <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a
                  live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>
                These simple rules create unexpected, emergent behavior. Keep a
                look out for the different patterns - still lifes (stable
                patterns), oscillators (periodic repeating patterns), and
                spaceships (traveling patterns). 
              </p>
              <p>
                The game runs itself and is randomly initialized on every page
                load.
